# Project__Topic_Modelling
A Topic Modeling Project using Twitter data to analyze underlying discussions during the first global Covid-19 major surge in  March/April 2020. 

The Covid19 pandemic swept across the world starting in March 2020 and was continuing throughout the time this report was generated in June 2021.
This is the first time that the world not only saw a lot of fear, grief, and sadness but also some of the best solidarity amongst the global citizens.
This project was conducted to find out the Covid19 pandemic related themes in depth, that were being discussed globally. 
The unprecedented impacts of the pandemic in terms of loss of human lives and health were evident, 
however they also caused a chain reaction that disrupted most of the industries, and in turn the world economy. 
Therefore, the focus was to illicit the subtle yet, profound effects on people’s lives and livelihood. 
The main goal was to generate a truthful epilogue of the people’s perceptions which can form the basis of ‘scientific analysis and debate’ with 
a view to learn from this unfortunate event of human history. The project was conducted by analyzing Twitter data from the first major surge of
 global Covid19 cases, in March/April 2020. It conducted Topic Modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and generated a summary 
list of topics discussed by the mass English speaking Twitter users.
