### Data
This should be done before running the first notebook. 
Please use [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wr3j5ksoKTn7A1BeIStQ4NEJry6NGu8p?usp=sharing) to download the original dataset into the 'data' folder.
Please Note: The link leads you to a google drive folder called 'Shreyas_Chitransh_Capstone_Data'. This folder has a compressed file within it, called 'data'.
This compressed file should be unzipped and the 'data' folder added to the 'Chitransh_Shreyas_Capstone' folder.
It contains 34 csv files with a combined 4GB of data. Please contact Shreyas at +1-416-262-0992 (or shch92@gmail.com) if there are any problems with these steps. Thanks!
